# odin-recipes

This project is to consolidate the lessons read up until now about HTML basic structure (such as text elements, lists, links and images) and Git workings (such as local machine Git and Github), to practice the fine art of git commit messages and to work with the command line.

The goal of this project is to apply the basic foundational structures learned so far - it is not meant to look like a sophisticated website.
